# Geoscience_Disciplines

In this project:
1. I pulled the many branches of geology from the paper "150 BRANCHES OF GEOLOGY(EARTH SCIENCES)" by A. Balasubramanian and compiled them into a list
2. I use this list to request the wikipedia content for each branch
3. I clean up the content for each wikipedia articl and use countvectorizer to generate a sparse matrix represnetation of the articles
4. Transform the data using UMAP to reduce the dimensions to 2
5. Finally I take the output of UMAP and we explore what clusters HDBSCAN finds within the data

Motivation for this project: The Structure of Recent Philosophy by Maximilian Noichl

This was purely a project to test out google colab and GitHub, so probably not the most technically sounds workflows were used. Just a fun side project.
