# Geoscience_Disciplines
First project to get the wheels running

In this project:
1. I pulled the many branches of geology from the paper "150 BRANCHES OF GEOLOGY(EARTH SCIENCES)" by A. Balasubramanian and compiled them into a list
2. I use this list to get the wikipedia content for each branch
3. I clean up the content for each wikipedia article, and use countvectorizer to run the umap algorithm on to reduce the dimensions to 2
4. Finally I take the output of UMAP and we explore what clusters HDBSCAN finds within the data

Motivation for this project: The Structure of Recent Philosophy by Maximilian Noichl
